# READ ME

This is a project for all the source code in < C++ Primer 5th>.

There are three types of code files: example(EXM), exercise(EXC), extension(EXT).
Examples are copied from the example code in the textbook.
exercises are my answers for the coding exercises in the textbook.
And extensions are my own thinking and extensions during learning.
